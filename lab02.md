## Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
It is important to choose a license because it informs any users exactly where they stand from a legal point of view. Licenses erase ambiguity when it comes to attribution, sharing, etc.
## Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit LICENSE
It's important to not use projects without an explicit license because your rights are not laid out and are probably restricted in unknown ways. The rights holder could come after you legally in the future for making use of what you assumed was an open source project.
## Why the Web beat Gopher
I agree with the claim that the web beat Gopher because of its open source principles. When creating something as *novel* as the internet, it's important to get feedback on what is important to users and not just developers. Even still Gopher was playing it close to the chest and not getting outside support from anybody, even developers.
## Why Android uses Apache 2.0 and GPL v2
The Apache 2.0 license and GPL v2 for Android are justified for several reasons. The reasoning behind the GPL v2 license is because Android uses the Linux kernel and as such is required to have the same copyleft license. The Apache 2.0 license prevents others from using Google's trademark, Android.
## Fictional Project/License
A Raspberry PI powered microwave. Choosing the MIT license allows us to not be liable in the case of a Raspberry PI powered explosion.
## GPL, LGPL, Apache/BSD
Apache is best for companies because it prevents others from using the trademarks. This allows the company to keep making money ergo keep developing the project.

GPL is best for developers because it allows others to use the code as they please but also place warranties on their versions.

LGPL is best for the common good because it fully informs all relevant information such as copyright or license, but you don't have to have a warranty and can't be held liable.

## Create a Repository and Choose a License
I added the MIT license to this repository. Meta.

## Choosing a Project/License
I would like to work on the [R2A03 Recompiler Project (RRP)](https://github.com/sakura57/rrp/). The license is the MIT license for maximum freedom for anybody looking to build upon the code. The users of this code will probably be nobody, but could be people interested in recompiling and machine code.
